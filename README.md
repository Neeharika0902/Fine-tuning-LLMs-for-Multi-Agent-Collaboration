# Fine-tuning-LLMs-for-Multi-Agent-Collaboration
Built a swarm-based multi-agent system using LangGraph to integrate fine-tuned LLMs (LLaMA 3.1, Falcon 7B, Mistral 7B, CodeT5). Automated SDLC tasks—code generation, QA, deployment, and documentation—with real-time collaboration, RAG, Airflow, and Snowflake.
